# Autonomous System 2018/2019 (as1819)

This repository will bundle all required repositories to run simulations and run the actual system on the car. The goal of this is to facilitate and streamline the setup process and to make it easier for new members to start developing. For this reason this repository will also include some high level guides on how to setup the system, run it, and will also give a high level overview of all the components.

For more information refer to the READMEs of the respective submodules.

## Overview


## Setup and usage of this repository
This repository mostly includes folders and [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Submodules are basically linked repositories inside a repository. This repository will always link to a certain state of all the submodules it refers to. Normally this should be the most-up-to-date master commit of the submodule, but when a repository updates a master this one will not automatically update with it. For now, this will manually be fixed as fast as possible (at least once a week). This slows down the development a bit, but on the other hand creates an extra opportunity to test the integration of new components into the whole system, whenever this repository updates all its submodules.
